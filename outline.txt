* Content modelling
* By default we think in unstructured content
* See Word
* But Contentful is all about structured content
* Relate to the database modelling
* entity-relationship model
* Doesn't quite work like that in Contentful
* No one gets it right the first time

* When you canâ€™t have perfection, the next best thing is change.
* When I joined Contentful you couldn't even delete a field. Disabling in the web app was the only thing available.
* Can change things either through the web app or the CMA

* What about staging changes before you hit production?
* Import/export tools only work with the entire space, not fine grained

* Introducing the Contentful miggration-cli
** Repeatable, have the same migration on multiple spaces
** Dry runs. Now what you do.
** Audit trail. Use CI

* Demo

** The future
** Integration with our main CLI
** Content transformations
** We want your Feedback!

* Thanks
